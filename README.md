Exploring English Fluency's Impact on Wages for immigrants 

This Repo stores an analysis conducted in my senior year of College. The analysis conducted examined the impact of English fluency for earnings of foreign-born indivduals. The goal was to replicate the study conducted in 1995 with modern data. Using data from the 2019 census, over 24 years have passed and the atmosphere in american has changed since then. 

##Update
I reconducted the analysis in Python, as it is a more industried standard language to use for data analysis. The data remains the same, and literature paper remains untouched.
